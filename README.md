# Bricks-Carousel---Sync 2 Carousels( Loop Mode Disabled )

# Custom Config
 - Center Mode without empty space.
 - Custom pagination
 - Horizontal/Vertical Thumbnail Carousel
 - Some tweak to solve swiper-slide-active class stop switching and no slideChange event fired issue, thumb and controller.control method that cannot achieve what I need.
 
 #1 Import the Section Template, set carousel 'Next' and 'Prev' navigation Icon (included), clear and set your own images, change last slide index number in Code Element script. It should work out of box.
 
 #2 This mainly meant for carousel that have more than 5 slides. 
 
 #3 Style for large screen only, the rest I just leave to you.
 
 #4 Tested with MB Image Advance field as dynamic content as well.
