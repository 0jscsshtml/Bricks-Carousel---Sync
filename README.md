# Bricks-Carousel---Sync 2 Carousels( Loop Mode Disabled )

# Custom Config
 - Center Mode without empty space.
 - Custom pagination
 - Horizontal/Vertical Thumbnail Carousel
 - Some tweak to solve swiper-slide-active class stop switching and no slideChange event fired when all slides are visible.
 
 #1 Import the Section Template, set carousel 'Next' and 'Prev' navigation Icon (included), set you images. it should work out of box.
 
 #2 This mainly meant for carousel that have more than 5 slides. 
 
 #3 Style for large screen only, the rest I just leave to you.
 
 #3 Tested with MB Image Advance field as dynamic content as well.
