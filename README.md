# Bricks-Carousel---Sync 2 Carousels( Loop Mode Disabled )

# Pain Points
 - Loop mode bloated DOM.
 - In Loop Mode disabled, when swiper wrapper fully translated and all slides are visible, swiper-slide-active class stop switching even current active slide is not yet reach to the last slide(thumbnail carousel).
 - Looking for posts in Bricks FB group and forum, get the idea of access the swiper instance for customization and would like to share back to community.
 
 #1 Import the Section Template, place it on page, it should work out of box. In case is not working, please cross check the script in Code Element with the carousels classname.
 
 #2 This mainly meant for carousel that have more than 5 slides.
 
 #3 Test Environment
  - Wordpress v6.2
  - Bricks v1.7.3
  - Localwp v6.7.1+6369
  - PHP v8.1.9
  - MySQL v8.0.16
